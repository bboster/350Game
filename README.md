Hello! Welcome to Multi-RPG

MultiRPG is a game where you take control of several unique party members in order to save them from enemies. The goal is to collect all of the keys from defeating the enemies, and exiting the dungeon with those keys.

There have been many changes since the prototype version of this game, and we are now in the vertical slice phase of development. Some of these changes include:
- Players now have to complete 6 rooms instead of 3 to collect all keys. These rooms remix previous and new enemies.
- Players can collect skill points to gain more health or more bullets. These can be spent in the pause menu.
- The doors to the next rooms are locked (and don't appear) until the player completes the previous room (the order would be room1, 2, 3...)
- There is a new enemy that looks like a cactus that does continuous damage to the player. This enemy cannot be killed, but rather is there to motivate the player to work faster at killing other enemies. 
- There is now a death/lose condition for the player.

Some known bugs for the game are:
- The quit and how to play button are not usable after the first playthrough, this is believed to be because of the sava data, but as of this moment we are unable to find a solution.
- If the game is built, the 3rd door will not show up, in engine, it works.
- If you leave a room with zero bullets and don't reload before collecting your key, you can no longer reload.

Thank you so much for reading, and we hope you enjoy the game!
